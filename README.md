# Fetching attachments from Microsoft-365 Outlook mail using Python script 

The sole purpose of this project is to eliminate the need of logging into your email, downloading the attachments locally, then calling them into your Python script.

Instead, this code walks us through the processes of extracting attachments by iterating through your Outlook inbox, loading them into Python in the form of a byte string for further processing.

###### We will be utilizing` Mac/Linux terminal`, `Python 3.9.6`, and `Anaconda`

#### Bonus Step. Setup a new environment in terminal:

###### In Linux/Mac terminal, create a virtual environment with Python to keep everything clean and reproducible

```
conda create -n jupytab-notebook-env python=3.9.6
conda activate jupytab-notebook-env
```
